Project Understandings:

Exponential Attenuation Behavior:
It shows that a small increase in shield thickness initially causes a large reduction in radiation. But after a certain point, increasing thickness gives diminishing returns.

Material Effectiveness:

If we run simulations for different materials, we'll get different curves.

Denser materials (like Lead) show steeper decay — meaning they block radiation faster.
Lighter materials (like Concrete or Water) decay more slowly — requiring more thickness.

Lead is the best per cm — but heavy, toxic, and expensive.

Steel is next best — strong, easier to fabricate, often used in nuclear reactors and bunkers.

Concrete is practical — cheap and bulky, good for buildings.

Water is underrated — great for neutron shielding, used in reactors (like in nuclear submarines).

Also understood the working of few tkinter and maplotlib functions.
