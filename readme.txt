The Radiation Shield Simulator

This project is intended to study the properties of radioactive shielding properties exhibited by various materials (lead, concrete, water, polyethylene, and steel).

Theory:

This projects makes use of the Radiation Attenuation Equation, 

I=I0 * e^-(μx), 

where

I= Transmitted radiational intensity
I0= Initial intensity
μ= Linear attenuation coefficient (material-specific, unit: cm⁻¹)
x= Thickness of the absorbing material (in cm)

Attenuation Coefficient Of Materials Used(cm^-1):

Lead= 1.24
Concrete= 0.12
Water= 0.09
Polyethylene= 0.06
Steel= 0.50

Output:

A beautiful, illustruos graph is plotted, which shows how radiation intensity drops with increasing thickness.
